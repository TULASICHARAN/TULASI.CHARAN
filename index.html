        <h3>Eat smaller meals and snacks more frequently. Eating six or seven or eight times a day might be more easily tolerated than eating the same amount of food in three meals.
          Talk to your provider. Sometimes, poor appetite is due to depression, which can be treated. Your appetite is likely to improve after depression is treated.
          Avoid non-nutritious beverages such as black coffee and tea; instead choose milk and juices.Try to eat more protein and fat, and less simple sugars.
          Walk or participate in light activity to stimulate your appetite. Drink beverages after a meal instead of before or during a meal so you do not feel as full.Plan meals to include your favorite foods.Try eating the high-calorie foods in your meal first.
          Use your imagination to increase the variety of food you're eating.Take advantage of times of the day when your appetite is best. For example, some people have a better appetite in the morning and can eat a larger breakfast.Don't waste your energy eating foods that provide little or no nutritional value (such as potato chips, candy bars, colas and other snack foods).</h3><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h3>
          Get more fruits and veggies in your day. Start your morning with a bowl of oatmeal and some blueberries. Aim for two servings of fruit and five servings of veggies each day. Eat less saturated and trans fats. Read the labels for the products you are purchasing. You may be surprised at the ingredients and opt for a different brand. Make a conscious effort to put less and less salt on your food, until just a dash is all you need. Try substituting honey in your coffee and opt for less sugary desserts. For instance, if you are craving dessert, try blending frozen bananas and topping it some strawberries. Drink more water and aim for drinking half your body weight in ounces. Choosing water over sugary drinks can help you lose weight, clear your complexion, and, since our bodies are made up of 70% water, you may feel healthier all around. Fill half of your dinner plate with a variety of vegetables or salad, add lean protein foods such as meat, fish, chicken or legumes (chickpeas, lentils, kidney beans etc) to take up a quarter of the plate, last add in grain foods such as rice, pasta or noodles to take up the remaining quarter of the plate. One of the main reasons people end up eating fast food or a bag of chips is because they are in a rush. Plan out your meals on the weekends, including your snacks, and purchase only what you need and prepare your food.
